## Hi there, I'm Molly! ðŸ‘‹
**Incoming Senior at University of Iowa, majoring in Electrical (Computer) Engineering**

**Loving to Learn Data Management, Embedded Systems, and Languages (Both Coding and Human Types)**

As a frequent new-topic-delver since I enjoy uncovering connections between information, from language to biology to coding, I love large spannning topics. This has included self learning of SQL and expanding my knowledge of machine learning and data analytics via my classes and my fellowship in [Break Through Tech](https://www.breakthroughtech.org/). This also includes my recent lab work involving LabVIEW and embedded systems, or a personal language learning project (that has sadly seen [delays](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Molly-M-Laugh/Molly-M-Laugh/refs/heads/main/Jan16VideoScreenshotZoom.PNG)). However as an engineer, I take responsibility towards the end-users and community impact, whether by clarifying minor LabVIEW interface layout specifics, seeking feedback on how their courses and my tutoring is going from my tutees, or by planning to involve the Spanish department in my project once my computer is returned and I finish my Java framework. With graduation and possibly continuation into a Master's approaching, I look forward to contributing and expanding my skills as needed to a local or an abroad data, cybersecurity, or electrical engineering industry.
